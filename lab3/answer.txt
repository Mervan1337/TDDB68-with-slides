1) We will implement 2 new members in the thread-struct. 
The first is a pointer-array containing children with pid:s as index.
The second member is a pointer to the parent of the current process. 

2) We will use a counter to keep track of who is the last process to exit. 
The last will do the necessary work to close the OS. Also we will have a pointer to its parent and a reference to its children.

3) We will use semaphore:s. (Can also use locks)
